This repo focuses on creating complex components:
The idea is that developers should first sketch their app's UI. Next, break down the UI into components - this is more a developed art. Breaking a page into too few components can make components unnecessarily complex and unwieldy to work with. Too many, however, and they become trivial and unnecessarily basic - it can make editing a function much more time intensive. It is a fine line, but the single-responsibility principle can be a very effective measure of necessary component complexity.
